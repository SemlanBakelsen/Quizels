# Quizels World Quiz
Quizels is a website with a simple quiz that asks questions about big things in the world.
## Responsive design
The website has been tested and built to be responsive for multiple screen sizes. The page was testing using Lighthouse with an accessibility score of 97.
## Bugs
- The score falsely adds a point on the second answer of the second question.
- It also adds a point falsely on the second option of question three.
- There's a false addition of two points on option 1.
    * This was fixed by only adding the event listener to the buttons once
